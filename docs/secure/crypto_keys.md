# Cryptographic Keys

A long-held is the belief that `root` should never be allowed to login directly, but should instead come from elevation from an unprivileged user. Nowadays, there are enough methods to allow `root` login without increasing your attack surface, thanks to cryptographic keys.

The most common keys are `RSA` keys, but others exist which are readily accepted by modern `sshd` daemons.

# Generate a New Key

The following command generates a `ed25519` key, similar to, but more modern (and recommended) than `RSA`.  You can generate an `RSA` key instead by simply replacing `ed25519` with `rsa`.

```
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "for root@mineos" -f ~/.ssh/mineos
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/mineos
Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/mineos.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:Maq2bflTz+vmKCRHcDcFM2o0IoXw41UnrYZSU4ZEju8 for root@mineos
...
$
```
In this example `-f ~/.ssh/mineos` is the filename of the private key to be generated. If this is omitted, it will default to `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`; this is often preferred, as it obviates the need to specify the `-i` identity file on subsequent steps.

## CONFIGURE THE HOST

It is very possible your default installation of `sshd` already is allowing this kind of direct `root` login.  We can verify on the destination server:

```
# grep -b2 -n "Root" /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
30-753-
31-754-#LoginGraceTime 2m
32:773:#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
33-808-#StrictModes yes
34-825-#MaxAuthTries 6
--
78-2113-# PasswordAuthentication.  Depending on your PAM configuration,
79-2177-# PAM authentication via ChallengeResponseAuthentication may bypass
80:2245:# the setting of "PermitRootLogin without-password".
81-2298-# If you just want the PAM account and session checks to run without
82-2367-# PAM authentication, then enable this but set PasswordAuthentication
--
137-3538-Banner /root/.ssh/banner
138-3563-Match user *
139:3576:PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
```

Line 32 shows `#PermitRootLogin`, which is actually a comment and therefore has no effect. A standard convention of configuration files, however, is to indicate the default value if unspecified (as a comment would do)--this means that plaintext passwords are already prohibited for `root` login, but cryptographic keys are OK.

Line 139 actually shows that for a user match of the user `root` connecting to this host, explicitly disallow plaintext passwords for `root` login.  Either of these `prohibit-password`s will work for this case, but the latter takes precedence.

Restart the `sshd` daemon according to your distribution. Depending on your install, it could be `service sshd restart` or `systemctl restart sshd` (or others).

## TEST THE NEW KEY

Back on your client machine, connect to your SSH host with the key:

```
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/mineos root@10.137.0.12
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/user/.ssh/mineos.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
root@10.137.0.12's password: 
Received disconnect from 10.137.0.12 port 22:2: Too many authentication failures
Disconnected from 10.137.0.12 port 22
```

Note, it is asking for `root`'s password, not your chosen passphrase. This is because while the identify file is being passed through, the `ssh` host is not aware of this key. Normally, we rectify this with `ssh-copy-id`. However, `root` doesn't have a password, so it's a catch-22 of how to get passwordless access without ever setting a password.

## COPY OVER THE PUBLIC KEY

Remember the design of a private key/public key system: only the private key is delicate--the public key is just that, freely sharable. In fact, any user that tries to misuse your public key is really only _providing you access_ rather than _stealing your access_.

With this in mind, let's copy the public key to the new host, somehow, then ultimately put the key in the correct location: `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

```
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/mineos mc@10.137.0.12
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/user/.ssh/mineos.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
mc@10.137.0.12's password: 

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'mc@10.137.0.12'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```
And now test it with the command:

```
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/mineos.pub mc@10.137.0.12
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@         WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!          @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Permissions 0644 for '/home/user/.ssh/mineos.pub' are too open.
It is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.
This private key will be ignored.
Load key "/home/user/.ssh/mineos.pub": bad permissions
mc@10.137.0.12's password: 
```

## CORRECT KEY PERMISSIONS

Set the private and public key to read-only and access is granted. Remember, passphrases are separate from the user's password--if you did not use a passphrase in the previous step, the login will be automatic.

```
$ chmod 400 ~/.ssh/mineos*
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/mineos mc@10.137.0.12
Enter passphrase for key '/home/user/.ssh/mineos':

## EXTEND CRYPTO KEY TO ROOT LOGIN

Because in the previous step we are able to confirm that there is only one `authorized_key`, and it matches the key we just generated, we can take a shortcut. On a more mature system, you will need to manually move the authorized key from `/home/mc/.ssh/authorized_keys` to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

Switch to `root` on the destination machine:

`# rsync -av --chown=root:root /home/mc/.ssh /root/`

The reason this is a shortcut is it fully duplicates all authorized users for `mc` to `root`. Any *and all* keys that would permit `mc` access would now do the same for `root`. If this does not match your intended userset, edit `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` to remove spurious entries.

## VERIFY AUTHORIZED_KEYS PERMISSIONS

`/.ssh` should be `700` and `authorized_keys` should be `400` or `600`.

```
# ll .ssh/ 
total 12
drwx------.  2 root root 4096 Jul  2 19:35 ./
drwx------. 10 root root 4096 Jul  2 20:00 ../
-rw-------.  1 root root   97 Jul  2 19:35 authorized_keys
```

## VERIFY OPERATION

```
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/mineos root@10.137.0.12
Enter passphrase for key '/home/user/.ssh/mineos': 
Welcome to Mineos-tkldev, TurnKey GNU/Linux 14.0 / TurnKey 9.13 Stretch

Last login: Fri Jul  2 20:01:30 2021 from 10.137.0.14
root@mineos-tkldev ~# 
```

It is attractive to omit the passphrase for truly instant, passwordless login. Establish your own threat model and decide what is best for your system and needs.

# Further Lockdown

## DISALLOW PLAINTEXT PASSWORDS
If cryptographic keys completely replace your user passwords for system login, you can further harden your server by disallowing passwords:

```
# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
#PasswordAuthentication yes
#PermitEmptyPasswords no
```
TO:
```
# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
PasswordAuthentication no
#PermitEmptyPasswords no
```

## USING SSH-AGENTS
As a convenience when using passphrases, you can use an SSH-AGENT to save you repetitive passphrase entry. Notice this login (and all subsequent logins until reboot) will automatically handle the passphrase prompt for you.

```
# ssh-add ~/.ssh/mineos
Enter passphrase for .ssh/mineos: 
Identity added: .ssh/mineos (for root@mineos)

$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/mineos root@10.137.0.12

You have new mail.
Last login: Fri Jul  2 20:06:55 2021 from 10.137.0.14
```

## USING SSH USER CONFIG
Finally, you can simplify the connection process by making all attempts to a host always use a given identity file. Add the following content (adjust as necessary) to `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host 10.137.0.12
        User root
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/mineos
        Port 22
```

Now, login with only the IP and notice it automatically uses your config to determine the identify file and intended user `root`:

```
$ ssh 10.137.0.12
Welcome to Mineos-tkldev, TurnKey GNU/Linux 14.0 / TurnKey 9.13 Stretch

# Conclusion

Cryptographic keys help reduce danger by eliminating the need to type passwords on foreign, potentially compromised hosts. It also greatly reduces attack surface by making unauthorized logins nearly impossible. In conjunction with other `sshd` security functions and firewalls, `sshd` can live peacefully and securely on your host.
