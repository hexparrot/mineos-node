# Server Hardening with iptables

`iptables` is a powerful and precise firewall; this document is to show how to configure `iptables` to conform to a default-deny access strategy: nothing goes through until expressly permitted. Such a setup is more time-consuming up front, but comes with great satisfaction of an iron-clad first-line-of-defense. From this point forward, this document will assume the host is live and accessible to the internet, and you are directly connected to the host via keyboard.

# Full Lockdown

Turn off receiving of all foreign packets--`DENY` on all the default policies of `INPUT`, `FORWARD`, and `OUTPUT`. The final command will flush out any existing rules, giving a clean slate.

```
# iptables -P INPUT DROP
# iptables -P FORWARD DROP
# iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
# iptables -F
```

## LOG ALL UNIDENTIFIED TRAFFIC

Creating logging rules before any additional rules is a great way to audit what and where is already hitting your server. It'll create a _little bit_ of extra noise at the start, but the verbosity of these logs and the way it is positioned in the chain is invaluable to creating this hardened ruleset.

```
# iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp -j LOG --log-prefix "tcp.in.dropped "
# iptables -A INPUT -p udp -m udp -j LOG --log-prefix "udp.in.dropped "
# iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp -m udp -j LOG --log-prefix "udp.out.dropped "
# iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp -j LOG --log-prefix "tcp.out.dropped "
```

All the logged traffic goes to `/var/log/messages` and contains the prefix designated above.

## DEFINE NEW CHAINS

Let's use chains to help us make each packet do an extra check based on origin. Create a chain called 'FRIENDLY' which will signify IP origins that are trusted and 'MALICIOUS' for traffic we know to be bad, reducing the noise further for `/var/log/messages`.

```
# iptables -N FRIENDLY
# iptables -N MALICIOUS
# iptables -A FRIENDLY -s 10.137.0.0/24 -m comment --comment "[known-friendly network]" -j ACCEPT
```

Note that simply because a packet is from the correct subnet (in this case a `/24`), this does not mean it is trusted traffic; it states specifically that it will accept only local traffic inbound from our future-indicated ports. But even with this rule in place, no traffic is being pushed to the `FRIENDLY` chain yet, so no new traffic could get through.

To lock it down even further, you can instead of the above, only open up to a single machine with a `/32`.

`# iptables -A FRIENDLY -s 10.137.0.16/32 -m comment --comment "[i only trust one machine during this delicate period]" -j ACCEPT`

Next, create separate chains for signifying allowed inbound and outbound ports.

```
# iptables -N STDIN
# iptables -N STDOUT
# iptables -I INPUT 1 -j MALICIOUS
# iptables -I INPUT 2 -j STDIN
```
The expected flow for an inbound packet can therefore be, in its entirety:
```
INPUT -> MALICIOUS -> STDIN -> FRIENDLY -> ACCEPT
INPUT -> MALICIOUS -> STDIN -> FRIENDLY -> LOG -> DROP
INPUT -> MALICIOUS -> STDIN -> LOG -> DROP
```

# Letting through Traffic
## ALLOW SSH

`ssh` can be further secured with various configuration changes, but that is beyond the scope of this document. We can make rules that are permissive for the services we care about without exposing the host unnecessarily. There are arguments to having `ssh` host on a different port, but this document does not endorse security-by-obscurity, and purposefully hosts on `22` to improve logging organization.

`# iptables -A STDIN -p tcp -m comment --comment "sshd standard port" -m tcp --dport 22 -j FRIENDLY`


This allows in foreign TCP/IP packets tagged port 22 (ssh) from the respective friendly subnet, but outbound traffic to complete the negotiation die immediately with the expected flow for outbound being `OUTPUT -> STDOUT -> LOG -> DROP`.  Let through traffic that is `ESTABLISHED` or `RELATED` to existing whitelisted packets:

`# iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT`

You should now be able to successfully initiate an `ssh` session from another machine. The rest of this document can now be completed remotely. Take a moment to review your iptables rules and get a feel for the path a packet might take, and how it would be subsequently logged.

```

## ALLOW DNS RESOLUTION

Many activies a server will perform will likely require DNS lookups. DNS operates on outbound UDP port 53, and since the only packets that would be put on the `STDOUT` chain would have to be from itself, we can `ACCEPT`, directly.

```
# ping minecraft.codeemo.com
ping: minecraft.codeemo.com: Temporary failure in name resolution

# iptables -I OUTPUT 2 -j STDOUT
# iptables -A STDOUT -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
# iptables -I INPUT 1 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

# ping minecraft.codeemo.com
PING minecraft.codeemo.com (167.71.248.91) 56(84) bytes of data.
 [snip]
```

Having DNS figured out means other common utilities for downloading applications will now be possible, easily.

## ALLOW WGET AND CURL

If you need to download an online file, it's easy to get files via `HTTP` and `HTTPS`

```
# iptables -A STDOUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -m comment --comment "allow outbound http" -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A STDOUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 443 -m comment --comment "allow outbound https" -j ACCEPT
```

## ALLOW ICMP (ping)

Let's let `ICMP` through. For now, friendly-inbound only, and any outgoing.

```
# iptables -A STDIN -p icmp -j FRIENDLY
# iptables -A STDOUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
```

## ALLOW LOCAL LOOPBACK INTERFACE

`# iptables -A STDOUT -o lo -m comment --comment "Permit loopback traffic" -j ACCEPT`

## LOGGING NEAR-HITS

There's now a newly-emerging logging opportunity: that is, to 1) catch traffic directed at listening ports but 2) are not from trusted subnets, and tag them separately.

```
# iptables -A FRIENDLY -p udp -m udp -j LOG --log-prefix "udp.in.foreign "
# iptables -A FRIENDLY -p tcp -m tcp -j LOG --log-prefix "tcp.in.foreign "
# iptables -A FRIENDLY -j DROP
```

# Understanding the Packet Flow

Let's look at the current rules so far. We use the parameters "-vnL" which gives us [v]erbose, [n]umeric ports, [L]ist rules. This also gives us packet/byte counters.

```
# iptables -vnL

```

Now, all inbound packets will traverse one of the following possible routes:

```
INPUT (related) -> ACCEPT
INPUT -> MALICIOUS -> STDIN -> FRIENDLY (trusted subnet) -> ACCEPT
INPUT -> MALICIOUS -> STDIN -> FRIENDLY -> LOG -> DROP
INPUT -> MALICIOUS -> STDIN -> LOG -> DROP
```

For easy organization, it is desirable to leave `INPUT` and `OUTPUT` unchanged; any additional rules can be added to `STDIN` or `STDOUT`. If you are adding more complex rules, consider appending new chains to `STDIN` to combine related rules. This allows you to make rules in batches, enabling them all or none, simply by removing the `STDIN ... -j NEWCHAIN` entry.

## WATCHING THE TRAFFIC

`# watch -n .5 iptables -vnL`

You can open a new terminal session that provides a real-time view of packets hitting your server. If you are trying to let a new service though, you'll see the packet show up first on the `INPUT` chain. Follow where the numbers increment to see where the packet ends up--if it doesn't increment the rule you expect to `ACCEPT` it through, then you'll instead see it increment `LOG` rules. The log rule will help you determine exactly what packet-matching component is not working.

## READING THE LOGS

Our logging rules will produce lines that append to `/var/log/messages`:
```
Jun 30 06:06:13 mineos-tkldev kernel: [ 8486.974964] tcp.in.dropped IN=eth0 OUT= MAC=00:16:3e:5e:6c:00:fe:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:08:00 SRC=10.137.0.14 DST=10.137.0.16 LEN=52 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=63 ID=758 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=56296 DPT=8443 WINDOW=64240 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0
```

There are resources online to help you understand each of these logged segments, but in the meantime it will suffice to be able to identify these key/value pairs:

`... tcp.in.dropped IN=eth0 ... SRC=10.137.0.14 DEST=10.137.0.16 ... DPORT=8443 ...`

`tcp.in.dropped` tells us it's a TCP packet, from a friendly subnet, inbound at 8443.

## DESIGNING NEW RULES TO ALLOW TRAFFIC

Writing a rule to allow inbound 8443 traffic through is simple; the reverse traffic is already handled with the `OUTPUT` rule `RELATED/ESTABLISHED`.

`# iptables -A STDIN -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8443 -m comment --comment "mineos webui" -j ACCEPT`

## GET RID OF TRASH-PACKETS

Let's find some packets that just don't make sense to ever honor, and drop them immediately.
```
# iptables -A MALICIOUS -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP
# iptables -A MALICIOUS -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN FIN,SYN -m comment --comment "[malicious packet patterns]" -j DROP
# iptables -A MALICIOUS -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN,RST -m comment --comment "[malicious packet patterns]" -j DROP
```

## GREPPING LOGS FOR COMFORT

We can easily remove excessive noise and get to the interesting lines using `grep`.

```
# grep 'tcp.in.dropped' /var/log/messages    #all tcp packets that showed up at silent ports
# grep 'tcp.in.foreign' /var/log/messages    #all tcp packets received at listening ports, from untrusted subnets
# grep 'udp.in.dropped' /var/log/messages    #all udp packets that showed up at silent ports
# grep 'udp.in.foreign' /var/log/messages    #all udp packets received at listening ports, from untrusted subnets

# grep 'tcp.in' /var/log/messages            #shorthand to see all unexpected tcp traffic (untrusted origin, unused port)
# grep 'in.dropped' /var/log/messages        #shorthand to see unused port traffic
```

# Doing Something with Foreign Connections

From above, remember `tcp.in.foreign` signifies any packets received on a listening port, but not from an accepted subnet. Or put another way: "actors that now know of a listening service." While simply having their packets pass through the firewall does not give them any access, we also have an option for more deliberate handling of their traffic. As an example, these packets can be rerouted, to an external [opencanary](https://github.com/thinkst/opencanary).

`in.foreign` packets will always want to be logged. You can also rely on additional services like [fail2ban](https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) to help manage consistent offenders.

Since `tcp.in.dropped` and `udp.in.dropped` will create again more noise in your logs, you can address this by adding blacklist rules that suppress logging of traffic that does nothing but distract. For example, on a Linux machine, you may not be interested in TCP/UDP 138 traffic (NetBIOS):

`Jun 30 13:39:49 officebear kernel: udp.in.dropped IN=eno1 OUT= MAC=ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:b0:6e:bf:bf:1d:c4:08:00 SRC=192.168.50.223 DST=192.168.50.255 LEN=229 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=128 ID=26400 PROTO=UDP SPT=138 DPT=138 LEN=209`

`# iptables -A MALICIOUS -p tcp -m tcp --dport 138 -m comment --comment "[unwanted netbios]" -j DROP`

Now, the traffic will no longer be logged, making all the remaining log entries comparatively more relevant. Repeat this process, [iteratively removing known-uninteresting lines until you're left with only interesting, relevant packets](http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/).

## REDIRECTING HOSTILE TRAFFIC

Recall earlier that `iptables` is only letting through `ssh` traffic from a friendly origin:

`# iptables -A FRIENDLY -s 10.137.0.0/24 -m comment --comment "[known-friendly network]" -j ACCEPT`

When `ssh` traffic arrives, it never hits an `ACCEPT` rule, so eventually it gets logged as `tcp.in.foreigner`--that is, it's marked as traffic bound for listening ports, but dropped due to being from an untrusted subnet. If a network honeypot is in place, `iptables` can capture that traffic while still letting through valid port 22 traffic with the 'negation' operator (!).

`iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING ! -s 10.137.0.0/24 -p tcp --dport 22 -j DNAT --to-destination 172.17.0.4:8022`

Any traffic that is _not_ from `10.137.0.0/24` _and_ is `ssh` inbound traffic, destination-NAT it to another address, on an arbitrary port. In this specific example, a docker container with the IP `172.17.0.4` is listening for `ssh` traffic--configured on port 8022--because the host has already bound port 22 to the existing, real `sshd` server.

# Save and Restore your Work

```
# iptables-save > ~/iptables.v4
# iptables-restore < ~/iptables.v4
```

Different distributions apply iptables in different ways, some use `iptables-persistent`, some put `iptables-restore` in `/etc/rc.local`, some expect the rules at `/etc/sysconfig/iptables`. Check your distribution manual for further details.

# Conclusion

`iptables` provides an immense amount of control of packet flow. Creating good rules from the outset will lower the effort required to maintain a secured system. There's much more `iptables` offers for the discerning sysadmin; check out the iptables man pages for more inspiration!
